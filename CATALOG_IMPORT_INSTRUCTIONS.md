## How to Use

### Option 1: Import Individual Categories

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run each file individually:
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   \i scripts/019_electronics_50.sql
   \i scripts/020_fashion_50.sql
   -- ... continue with other files
   ```

### Option 2: Import All at Once

Once all files are created:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the master script:
   ```sql
   \i scripts/031_import_all_categories.sql
   ```

### Option 3: Run Directly in Supabase

Copy and paste the contents of each SQL file directly into Supabase SQL Editor and execute.

## Verification

After importing, verify with:

```sql
-- Total products
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_products FROM public.products;

-- Products by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as product_count 
FROM public.products 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY product_count DESC;

-- Should show ~50 products per category
```

## Next Steps

I can create the remaining 10 category files. Each will have:
- 50 unique products
- Real Unsplash images
- Appropriate pricing
- Stock quantities
- Unique SKUs

Would you like me to:
1. **Create all remaining 10 files now** (complete catalog)
2. **Create a few at a time** (staggered approach)
3. **Start with specific categories** (your choice)

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
