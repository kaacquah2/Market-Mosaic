## Current Progress

**Progress: 200 / 650 products (31%)**

## How to Use Current Files

### Step 1: Cleanup
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i scripts/000_cleanup_before_import.sql
```

### Step 2: Import Available Categories
```sql
-- Import the 4 completed categories
\i scripts/019_electronics_50.sql
\i scripts/020_fashion_50.sql
\i scripts/021_food_50.sql
\i scripts/022_kitchen_50.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.products 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Expected: 4 categories with 50 products each (200 total)

## Next Steps

I can create the remaining 9 category files with 50 products each. Would you like me to:

**Option A**: Create all 9 remaining files now (complete catalog)
**Option B**: Create a few at a time (test-as-you-go)
**Option C**: Start with specific categories you need most

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
