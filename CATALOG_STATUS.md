## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Cleanup
```sql
\i scripts/000_cleanup_before_import.sql
```

### Step 2: Import Available Categories
```sql
\i scripts/019_electronics_50.sql
\i scripts/020_fashion_50.sql
\i scripts/021_food_50.sql
\i scripts/022_kitchen_50.sql

SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.products 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected: 5 categories with 50 products each (250 total)**

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Create the remaining 8 category files** (recommended for complete catalog)
2. **Use the current 250 products** as a starting point
3. **Create specific categories** you need most

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
