# üéØ HOW TO IMPORT PRODUCTS - CORRECT METHOD

## ‚ùå Don't Use This Command
Supabase SQL Editor does NOT support `\i` commands. 

## ‚úÖ Correct Method

### Step 1: Open the File
Open `scripts/complete_all_products.sql` in your code editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)

### Step 2: Copy ALL Content
Press `Ctrl+A` to select ALL content in the file
Press `Ctrl+C` to copy it

### Step 3: Paste into Supabase
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New Query"
4. Press `Ctrl+V` to paste the entire file
5. Click "Run" button

### Step 4: Verify
After running, check the results:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_products FROM public.products;
-- Should show 650
```

## üìù Alternative: Copy Individual Categories

If the file is too large to copy at once:

1. Run cleanup first:
```sql
DELETE FROM public.order_items;
DELETE FROM public.cart_items;
DELETE FROM public.wishlist_items;
DELETE FROM public.product_reviews;
DELETE FROM public.products;
```

2. Then copy and paste each category file one by one:
- `scripts/019_electronics_50.sql`
- `scripts/020_fashion_50.sql`
- `scripts/021_food_50.sql`
- `scripts/022_kitchen_50.sql`
- `scripts/023_home_50.sql`
- `scripts/024_sports_50.sql`
- `scripts/025_beauty_50.sql`
- `scripts/026_office_50.sql`
- `scripts/027_books_50.sql`
- `scripts/028_toys_50.sql`
- `scripts/029_pets_50.sql`
- `scripts/030_essentials_50.sql`
