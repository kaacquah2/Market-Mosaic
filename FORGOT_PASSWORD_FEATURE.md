# Forgot Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a complete forgot password feature to the login page with email-based password reset functionality.

## Features Added

### 1. Login Page Enhancement (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
- **"Forgot password?" link** next to the password field
- **Modal dialog** for password reset request
- **Email pre-population** from login form
- **Success/error states** with proper feedback
- **Loading states** during API calls

### 2. Password Reset Page (`app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`)
- **New page** for handling password reset from email links
- **Session validation** to ensure valid reset tokens
- **Password confirmation** with validation
- **Success feedback** with auto-redirect to login
- **Error handling** for invalid/expired links

## User Flow

### Step 1: Request Password Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on login page
2. Modal opens with email field (pre-filled from login form)
3. User enters email and clicks "Send Reset Link"
4. Success message shown: "Check your email for a password reset link"

### Step 2: Reset Password
1. User receives email with reset link
2. Clicks link â†’ redirected to `/auth/reset-password`
3. Enters new password and confirmation
4. Password updated successfully
5. Auto-redirected to login page after 3 seconds

## Technical Implementation

### Supabase Integration
- Uses `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` for sending reset emails
- Uses `supabase.auth.updateUser()` for updating password
- Simplified flow without token validation

### UI Components Used
- `Dialog` - Modal for forgot password form
- `Card` - Layout containers
- `Input` - Form inputs
- `Button` - Action buttons
- `Label` - Form labels
- Icons: `Mail`, `CheckCircle`, `AlertCircle`

### State Management
- Loading states for both forms
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success states with clear feedback
- Form validation (password length, confirmation match)

## Security Features
- **Password requirements** - Minimum 8 characters
- **Password confirmation** - Must match
- **Auto-redirect** - Prevents staying on reset page after success
- **Error handling** - Clear messages for validation errors

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added forgot password modal and functionality

### Created:
- `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - New password reset page

## Environment Configuration
The reset emails will redirect to:
```
${window.location.origin}/auth/reset-password
```

Make sure your Supabase project is configured with the correct redirect URLs.

## Testing the Feature

1. **Test forgot password flow:**
   - Go to `/auth/login`
   - Click "Forgot password?"
   - Enter email and submit
   - Check email for reset link

2. **Test password reset:**
   - Click reset link from email
   - Enter new password
   - Confirm password update
   - Verify redirect to login

## Error Scenarios Handled
- Invalid email addresses
- Network errors during email sending
- Password mismatch during confirmation
- Password too short (less than 8 characters)
- General authentication errors

## Future Enhancements
- Email templates customization
- Rate limiting for password reset requests
- Password strength requirements
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- SMS-based password reset option
