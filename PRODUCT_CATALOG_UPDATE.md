## How to Apply the Update

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of scripts/018_replace_all_products.sql
```

Or run it via command line:

```bash
# If you have psql installed
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f scripts/018_replace_all_products.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify the Update

After running the script, verify:

```sql
-- Check total product count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_products FROM public.products;

-- Check products by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as product_count 
FROM public.products 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY product_count DESC;

-- Check products with stock
SELECT COUNT(*) as in_stock_products 
FROM public.products 
WHERE stock_quantity > 0;
```

Expected results:
- Total products: 40
- 7 categories
- All products have stock

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Product Details

### Price Range
- Lowest: $14.99 (Portable Phone Stand)
- Highest: $299.99 (Gaming Monitor 144Hz)
- Average: ~$85

### Stock Management
- All products have realistic stock quantities
- Stock ranges from 22 to 156 units
- Average stock: ~72 units per product

### Image Quality
- All images are 600x600px high-resolution
- Sourced from Unsplash's professional photography
- Properly sized for web display
- Fast loading optimized URLs

## Product Uniqueness

These products are **completely different** from:
- Amazon catalog
- Melcom inventory
- Other generic e-commerce sites

They focus on:
- Quality and functionality
- Modern lifestyle needs
- Unique value propositions
- Professional presentation

## Database Schema

The products table includes these fields:
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `name` - Product name
- `description` - Detailed description
- `price` - Price in USD
- `category` - Category name
- `image_url` - Unsplash image URL
- `stock_quantity` - Available stock
- `sku` - Unique SKU code
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## Unsplash API

### Current Setup
- Using Unsplash public source URLs
- No API key required for the seed script
- Images are optimized for web delivery

### Optional: Get Your Own API Key
If you want to use Unsplash API for dynamic image fetching:

1. Visit https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new application
4. Copy your **Access Key** (public) and **Secret Key** (private)
5. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Access Key (public): Use in client-side requests
   NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
   
   # Secret Key (private): Use in server-side requests only
   UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

### API Usage Limits
- Free tier: 50 requests/hour
- Access Key: Public, can be used in client-side code
- Secret Key: Private, use only in server-side API routes
- No credit card required for basic usage

### Security Note
- **Access Key**: Safe to expose in client-side code (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`)
- **Secret Key**: NEVER expose in client-side code (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
- Always use Secret Key in server-side API routes for sensitive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Products Not Showing
```sql
-- Check if products exist
SELECT * FROM public.products LIMIT 5;

-- Check if stock_quantity column exists
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'products';
```

### Images Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Ensure Supabase RLS policies allow public read access

### Missing Categories
- All categories are included in the seed script
- Verify your frontend filters support all categories
- Check category names match exactly

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the SQL script to replace products
2. ✅ Verify products load correctly
3. ✅ Check images display properly
4. ✅ Test filtering by category
5. ✅ Verify stock quantities show correctly
6. ✅ Test adding products to cart
7. ✅ Test checkout flow

## Customization

### Adding More Products
Edit `scripts/018_replace_all_products.sql` and add:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.products (name, description, price, category, image_url, stock_quantity, sku) VALUES
('Your Product Name', 'Product description', 99.99, 'Category Name', 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...', 50, 'SKU-XXX');
```

### Changing Images
Replace the Unsplash URL with any 600x600 image URL:
```sql
image_url = 'https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg'
```

### Updating Stock
```sql
UPDATE public.products 
SET stock_quantity = 100 
WHERE sku = 'ELEC-001';
```
