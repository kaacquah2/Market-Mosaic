# Product Reviews Setup Guide

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Error:** `Error fetching reviews: {}`

**Root Cause:** The `product_reviews` table doesn't exist in your Supabase database yet.

**Solution:** Made the review service more resilient to handle missing tables gracefully + created SQL migration to set up the table.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Updated Review Service (`lib/review-service.ts`)

Added proper error handling:
- Wrapped queries in try-catch blocks
- Silently returns empty arrays/null when table doesn't exist
- Only logs actual errors (not missing table errors)
- Won't spam console with errors before table is set up

### 2. ‚úÖ Created Database Migration

Created `scripts/create_product_reviews_table.sql` to set up:
- `product_reviews` table with proper schema
- Foreign key relationships to products and users
- Rating constraints (1-5 stars)
- Unique constraint (one review per user per product)
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic timestamp updates

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Run the SQL Script (Recommended)

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file: `scripts/create_product_reviews_table.sql`
4. Copy and paste the entire contents
5. Click **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
6. You should see: `product_reviews table created successfully`

### Option 2: The app will work without reviews

The app is now resilient - it will:
- ‚úÖ Display products without reviews
- ‚úÖ Show "No reviews yet" message
- ‚úÖ Allow users to browse without errors
- ‚úÖ Only show review form when table exists

You can set up reviews later when needed!

## Features Included

Once the table is set up, users can:

### For Customers:
- ‚úÖ View all product reviews
- ‚úÖ See average ratings and star distributions
- ‚úÖ Write reviews (only after purchasing)
- ‚úÖ Edit their own reviews
- ‚úÖ Delete their own reviews
- ‚úÖ One review per product per user

### For Admins:
- ‚úÖ View all reviews
- ‚úÖ Delete any review (moderation)
- ‚úÖ Edit any review if needed
- ‚úÖ See review analytics

### Security Features:
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ‚úÖ Users can only modify their own reviews
- ‚úÖ Everyone can read reviews
- ‚úÖ Must be authenticated to write reviews
- ‚úÖ Admins have full control

## Database Schema

```sql
product_reviews {
  id              UUID PRIMARY KEY
  product_id      UUID ‚Üí products(id)
  user_id         UUID ‚Üí auth.users(id)
  rating          INTEGER (1-5)
  title           TEXT (optional)
  comment         TEXT (optional)
  created_at      TIMESTAMP
  updated_at      TIMESTAMP
}
```

## Testing

After running the SQL script:

1. **Visit any product page** - Should load without errors
2. **Check console** - No more "Error fetching reviews" messages
3. **Try adding a review** - (requires login and purchase)
4. **View reviews section** - Should show "No reviews yet" if empty

## Next Steps

Once the table is created:
- Users who have purchased products can leave reviews
- Reviews will appear on product pages
- Average ratings will be calculated automatically
- Star ratings will display on product cards

---

**Status:** The error is now handled gracefully. Run the SQL script when you're ready to enable the full review system! üåü
