The shipping address form now includes **ALL countries** instead of just 8 countries.

- Includes countries from:
  - North America (US, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean)

  - Europe (all EU countries + UK, Russia, etc.)
  - Asia (China, Japan, India, Southeast Asia, Middle East)
  - Africa (Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, etc.)
  - Oceania (Australia, New Zealand)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `components/shipping-address-form.tsx`

### Changes Made
1. Added `COUNTRIES` constant array with ISO country codes and names
2. Updated the Select component to dynamically render all countries
3. Added `max-h-[300px]` to limit dropdown height for better UX

### Country Selection Implementation
```tsx
<SelectContent className="max-h-[300px]">
  {COUNTRIES.map((country) => (
    <SelectItem key={country.code} value={country.code}>
      {country.name}
    </SelectItem>
  ))}
</SelectContent>
```

## Benefits

1. **Global Support**: Customers from anywhere can place orders
2. **Better UX**: Users can find their country easily
3. **International Expansion**: Ready for worldwide shipping
