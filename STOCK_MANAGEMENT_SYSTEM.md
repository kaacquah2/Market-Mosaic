# Stock Management System

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your e-commerce app now has a **fully functional stock management system** that automatically reduces inventory when purchases are made.

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Stock Validation Before Checkout**

When a customer tries to checkout, the system validates stock availability:

```typescript
// In app/api/checkout/route.ts
- Checks each product in the cart
- Verifies sufficient stock is available
- Returns an error if stock is insufficient
```

**Example Error Messages:**
- ❌ `"Insufficient stock for 'Product Name'. Only 5 available, but 10 requested."`
- ❌ `"Product 'Product Name' not found"`

### 2. **Automatic Stock Reduction**

After a successful order is placed, stock is automatically reduced:

```typescript
// Stock reduction happens immediately after order creation
For each product in the order:
  - Fetch current stock quantity
  - Reduce by ordered quantity
  - Update database
  - Log the change
```

**Example:**
- Product has 50 units in stock
- Customer orders 3 units
- After order: **47 units remain**

### 3. **Stock Protection**

The system prevents negative stock:
- Minimum stock level is **0**
- Uses `Math.max(0, currentStock - orderedQuantity)`
- Cannot go below zero

## 🎨 Visual Stock Indicators

### On Product Pages

The product detail pages now show color-coded stock status:

#### 🔴 **Out of Stock** (0 units)
```
Red badge: "Out of Stock"
- Add to Cart button disabled
- Shows "Out of Stock" on button
- Quantity selector disabled
```

#### 🟡 **Low Stock** (1-9 units)
```
Yellow badge: "⚠️ Only X left in stock!"
- Creates urgency for customers
- Quantity selector limited to available stock
- Add to Cart enabled
```

#### 🟢 **In Stock** (10+ units)
```
Green badge: "✓ In Stock (X available)"
- Full functionality enabled
- Quantity selector works normally
- Shows total available quantity
```

### In Admin Dashboard

Admins can see stock levels in multiple places:

1. **Dashboard** - Low stock alerts
2. **Products Page** - Stock count on each product card
3. **Inventory Management** - Full inventory overview with filters
